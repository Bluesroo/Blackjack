I'm reviving this as a fun project. I've kept the old version for posterity.

Things to do better:
1. Make healthy use of functions (and pointers) and header files in order to keep main clean.
2. Use better variable names.
3. Deal with the deck running out.
4. Use file i/o in order to keep the code base smaller (no hard-coding the deck).
