Blackjack
=========

There are two copies of the game in this repo:
1. blackjackOld.c
2. blackjack.c

blackjackOld.c is an abomination that I made as I was first starting to learn how to program. I kept it around because I like looking back at it everyone once in a while.

blackjack.c is the new(er) version that I made after taking my first real computer engineering class Fall 2013. It is significantly less awful, but it is just very basic. As you can see from the previous commits, it is from quite a while ago (relatively speaking).
