Blackjack
=========

My first attempt at a serious project... Things to implement for the next version, when I decide to try again:
1. Use functions and pointers
2. Figure out what to do when the deck runs out (how to reshuffle?)
3. Use descriptive variable names
4. Learn how to read/ write to a file (variables, the deck, counters?)
